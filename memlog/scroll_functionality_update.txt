2023-10-XX - Scroll Functionality Update

Updated app/page.tsx to add scroll-to functionality for the "Start Creating" button. The button now scrolls smoothly to the element with class .p-8 when clicked.

Changes made:
- Added onClick event to the "Start Creating" Button component.
- Implemented scrollIntoView method with smooth behavior.

Verified that the change works as expected.
