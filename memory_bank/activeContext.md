# Current Task
Implemented a responsive two-panel layout for the Advanced QR Code Generator with a scrollable controls panel and a fixed QR code display area.

## Progress
-   **Phase 1: Integrating the Advanced QR Code Generator - Complete**
    -   Ported the core QR code generation logic from the Antfu toolkit.
    -   Created the `AdvancedQrGenerator.tsx` component with a full suite of UI controls.
    -   Replaced the existing `QRCodeModal.tsx` with a new modal that houses the advanced generator.
    -   All necessary dependencies have been added and installed.
    -   Fixed `TypeError: can't access property "value", _state__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__.qrcode is undefined` by converting `qrcode`, `generateQRCodeInfo`, and `dataUrlGeneratedQRCode` to Valtio proxies in `src/lib/state.ts`.
    -   Addressed `Error: Unreachable` by preventing `generateQRCode` from running on initial render if `state.text` is empty in `components/AdvancedQrGenerator.tsx`.
    -   Implemented a new responsive layout for `AdvancedQrGenerator.tsx` with a fixed header, scrollable controls panel, and fixed QR code display area.

## Next Steps
-   Verify the new layout and functionality by running the application locally.

## Current Blockers
-   None.
