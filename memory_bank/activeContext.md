# Current Task
Troubleshoot and verify the implementation of the Advanced QR Code Generator.

## Progress
-   **Phase 1: Integrating the Advanced QR Code Generator - Complete**
    -   Ported the core QR code generation logic from the Antfu toolkit.

## Next Steps
-   Thoroughly test the `AdvancedQrGenerator` component to ensure all options work as expected.
-   Verify that the generated QR code is correctly passed to the main form.
-   Address any bugs or inconsistencies found during testing.

## Current Blockers
