# Current Task
Completed comprehensive software archeology of the QR Styler codebase to facilitate new team member onboarding.

## Progress
-   Thoroughly analyzed the project's architecture, core user flows (Authentication, Subscription/Payments, Image Generation), data models, and frontend structure.
-   Reviewed and updated all core Memory Bank documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) with detailed insights from the codebase analysis.
-   Gained a deep understanding of key integrations (NextAuth.js, Stripe, Replicate, Vercel Blob) and their implementation.
-   Documented database schema evolution through migrations.
-   Identified and documented core components and styling strategies (Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui).

## Next Steps (for a new team member)
1.  **Review Memory Bank**: Read through all the updated documentation files in the `memory_bank` directory to gain a foundational understanding of the project.
2.  **Environment Setup**: Follow the instructions in `memory_bank/techContext.md` (Development Environment, Development Commands, Environment Variables sections) to set up the local development environment.
3.  **Code Exploration**: Begin exploring the codebase, focusing on the core user flows outlined in `memory_bank/systemPatterns.md`.
4.  **Initial Testing**: Run the development server (`npm run dev`) and perform basic smoke tests of the main features (sign-in, QR code generation, subscription page).

## Current Blockers
-   None. The codebase has been thoroughly analyzed and documented for onboarding purposes.
