# Project Brief: QR Styler

## Purpose and Vision
QR Styler is a web application designed to revolutionize QR code usage by transforming standard, often unappealing, QR codes into aesthetically pleasing, brand-aligned designs. Leveraging advanced AI technology, the platform ensures that while the visual appeal is significantly enhanced, the core functionality of perfect scannability is always maintained.

## Problems Solved
- **Lack of Brand Integration**: Traditional QR codes are generic and do not reflect brand identity, leading to a disconnect in marketing materials. QR Styler enables businesses and marketers to create QR codes that seamlessly integrate with their brand aesthetics.
- **Aesthetic Limitations**: Designers and individuals often struggle to create visually appealing QR codes that stand out. This platform provides tools to generate unique, stylized QR codes that are both functional and beautiful.
- **Monetization Challenges**: Provides a clear path for monetizing advanced QR code generation features through a tiered subscription model.

## Core Requirements and Goals
1.  **AI-Powered Styling**: Implement robust AI models capable of generating diverse and creative QR code designs while preserving scannability.
2.  **User Authentication & Management**: Provide secure user authentication (Google OAuth, Email/Password) and comprehensive user management features, including subscription status and usage tracking.
3.  **Tiered Subscription Model**: Develop a flexible subscription system with distinct tiers (Free, Basic, Premium) offering varying features, usage limits, and processing priorities, integrated with Stripe for seamless payments.
4.  **Image Gallery & Customization**: Offer users a personal gallery to manage their generated QR codes and provide extensive customization options for design parameters.
5.  **Scalable Infrastructure**: Build on a modern tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Replicate, Stripe) to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.
6.  **Comprehensive API**: Design a well-structured API for authentication, subscription management, and image generation to support the frontend and potential future integrations.
7.  **Deployment & Monitoring**: Ensure reliable deployment (Vercel) and establish monitoring for system health, usage, and error rates.

## Project Scope
The project encompasses the full lifecycle of stylized QR code generation, from user authentication and subscription management to AI-powered design, image storage, and deployment. Future enhancements include advanced analytics, additional payment options, and team features.
