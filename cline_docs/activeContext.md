# Recent Changes - Gallery Image Loading Fix

## Issue
- Gallery images were not displaying in production deployment
- Images were working in local development but failing in production

## Investigation & Fixes
1. Next.js Image Configuration
   - Added wildcard support for Vercel Blob storage domains in next.config.js
   - Ensures all possible Vercel Blob storage URLs are allowed

2. Image Loading Improvements
   - Added comprehensive logging in UserGallery component
   - Added fallback UI with placeholder image icon
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback

3. Authentication Configuration
   - Identified NEXTAUTH_URL needs to be updated in production environment
   - Local development uses http://localhost:3000
   - Production needs matching deployed URL

## Implementation Details
1. next.config.js:
   - Added `*.public.blob.vercel-storage.com` to remotePatterns
   - Ensures all Vercel Blob storage domains are supported

2. UserGallery.tsx:
   - Added detailed logging for image fetch requests/responses
   - Added logging for successful image loads with dimensions
   - Added logging for image load errors
   - Implemented fallback UI for failed image loads

## Next Steps
1. Monitor production logs for:
   - Image loading success/failure rates
   - Specific problematic image URLs
   - Authentication session issues

2. Verify in production:
   - NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable is correctly set
   - Image domains are properly whitelisted
   - Database connections are working

## Technical Notes
- Images are stored in Vercel Blob storage
- URLs are stored in PostgreSQL database
- Next.js Image component requires domain whitelisting for security
