Summary of the Issue and Resolution:

Problem:

Gallery showed "0 images found" despite having 6 images in the database
Debug output confirmed:
Authentication was working
Database had 6 images
All image URLs were accessible (status 200)
Images were being returned by the API
Investigation:

Checked database schema (src/schema.ts)

Confirmed proper structure for generatedImages table
All required fields present (id, imageUrl, prompt, etc.)
Checked API endpoint (app/api/user/images/route.ts)

Confirmed proper data fetching
Verified URL accessibility checks
Confirmed proper response format
Checked UserGallery component

Found mismatch between API response and component state handling
Identified need for better error handling and debugging
Solution:

Added proper TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety
Fixed state management in UserGallery component
Added comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline
Added proper error handling for image loading
Added debug information display
Critical Details:

Images are stored in Vercel Blob storage
URLs follow pattern: https://[store-id].public.blob.vercel-storage.com/[filename]
next.config.js includes proper image domains for Vercel Blob
Database stores image metadata and URLs
Component uses next/image for optimized image loading
